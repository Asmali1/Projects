<MOHAMED ASMALI>
BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL
OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE MYSELF WITH
NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE
OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.
1.	Within gdb, the value of the variable i before the initialization is: 
- 0
2. Within gdb, the value of the variable i after the initialization is: 
- 1
3. What does touch do and why did it change the behavior of make? 
- Touch updates the modification date of a file. 
- It changed the behavior of make because of changing the medication date of lab1.c requires the rebuilding of its target.
4. In gdb, you walked through the code using next and using step â€“ describe the differences in their behavior: 
- Using a step allows you to go line by line in a function.
- Using next allows you to see a function call as a single line of code, meaning you can see the value of variables before and after the call.
5. In gdb, what did finish do? 
- Finishes completing the current function and reports the value returned.
6. On the final run, after you set the value of x to 200, what was the value of i back in the calling function? 
-1 
7. What kind of recognizable things were found in the tags file?
- It showed the function prototypes
8. How do the contents of the .vs file compare to your C code? 
- The C code has the function definitions
- The .vs contains the function prototype
9. Give the line number and filename for where the zd executable crashed. 
- Crashed at line 25
- Filename: zd.c
10. What was the value of p in zd when zd crashed? 
- 25
11. What did the backtrace command show you in gdb? 
- The backtrace command shows you the frame number at the beginning. The higher names are closer to main and the lower numbers are things that were called recently. Backtrace also shows the functions, their parameter values, and the file name where the functions are located.
12. What are you expected to do before asking anyone for help with a run-time crash of your program?
- Run gdb
